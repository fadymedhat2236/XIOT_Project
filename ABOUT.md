# Goals of the solution

1-this solution aimed to use many module of the board,GPIO,timers,UARTS,ADC and interrupts.

2-the whole solution is built using interrupts so any added code in the main won't affect the solution.

3-I tried to use real simulation and there are two  small videos that shows the project while working.

# Previous Experience

1-I took an embedded systems diploma where I studied c,embedded c,interfacing with atmega 32 and RTOS.

2-made projects using atmega32 such as one led matrix and three led matrix that can be found in the following repo 
>https://github.com/fadymedhat2236/atmega-32-codes

3-at college i studied interfacing with arm using tm4c123gh6pm launchpad and the  arm assembly language.

4-made different projects using tm4c123gh6pm as distance meter ,UART serial interfacing that can be found here

4-made RC car with arduino while integrating it with some sensors.
